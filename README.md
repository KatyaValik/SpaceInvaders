## About

This project is a remake of the famous game Space Invaders with some features.

Space Invaders is a two-dimensional fixed shooter game in which the player controls a ship by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat all aliens that move horizontally back and forth across the screen as they advance towards the bottom of the screen. There are two types of aliens: ordinary and tenacious. Ordinary aliens are white, one bullet is enough to destroy them. Tenacious aliens are red, they are destroyed by two shots. The player defeats an alien, and earns points, by shooting it with bullets. 

Initially, the player has three lives. The aliens attempt to destroy the player's ship by firing at it while they approach the bottom of the screen. If they reach the bottom, the alien invasion is successful and the game swithes on the next level. A special "mystery ship" will occasionally move across the top of the screen and award bonus points if destroyed. The ship is partially protected by several stationary defense shelters that are gradually destroyed by projectiles from the aliens.
